**What:** A simple point keeping app that lets you increment and decrement points for multiple players.
**Why:** To have a quick and easily usable application for any simple games such as card games, board games, etc. To save any paper used for tallying points.
**How:** Web app built using React. Uses MaterialUI for responsive and mobile friendly design and GitHub Pages to host. 

What about other score keeping apps that are out there?
_I'm sure there are a ton of apps out there that do the exact same thing, but this app was a good way to apply my knowledge of React and create an app I'd actually use. There are also very complicated apps which defeat the purpose of replacing the ease of using a paper and pencil. This app has no extra requirements or procedures to use this app.

Prototype 1:
+ Static web app with 5 hard coded players each with there own state for points.

Next prototype:
+ Dynamically add or remove players
