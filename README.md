A web app for tracking points for any game. This simple app helps you track the score for multiple players while playing a game. You can increase or decrease the score. It saves and remembers the score until the page is refreshed. This app was a great way to apply my knowledge of React and it's a great way to save the paper used in board games or card games to tally points.
